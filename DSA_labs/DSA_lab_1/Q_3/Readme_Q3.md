# Triangular Matrix Generator

Write a function that takes a `3X3 matrix` as input and returns a matrix having lower triangular matrix and upper triangular matrix.

## Input Format: 
- Three consecutive lines, each containing three space-separated integers. Each line represents a row of a 3x3 matrix.
## Output Format: 
- Output the lower triangular matrix and upper triangular matrix in 3 lines keeping 6 integers in a single line.

## Sample Input:
6 5 4<br>
1 2 5<br>
7 9 7<br>

## Sample Output:
6 0 0 6 5 4<br>
1 2 0 0 2 5<br>
7 9 7 0 0 7<br>
