# I-Path Sum in a Matrix

## Problem Statement

Given a matrix `M`, return the sum of the "I" path from it. The "I" path consists of the elements in the top row, bottom row, and the middle column of the matrix.

### Input Format:
1. The first line contains two integers `N` and `M`, which represent the dimensions of the matrix, where `M` is odd.
2. The next `N` lines each contain `M` space-separated integers representing the rows of the matrix.

### Output Format:
- A single integer, representing the sum of the "I" path in the matrix.

### Constraints:
- Matrix dimensions are such that `M` is always odd.

### Example:

#### Input:
```
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
```

#### Output:
```
39
```
